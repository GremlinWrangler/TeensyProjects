Useless Box design notes

Concept was to fit a folding finger mechanism with an additinal point of articulation into a 
shallow box while remaining strong enough to push the switch.

See open scad file for various failed iterations that ended up with a co-axial mechanism 
where one servo drove two curved arms to lift finger into position while second servo motor 
drove a pivoting lever that in turn offered a limited range of finger motion, independant
of lift position.

Due to leverage effects and loose tolerances in the 3D printed parts switch had to be
modified by removal of one of two spring plates to allow switching

Early designs had a postive locking lid. Discarded when the potential for any software bug
to prevent access to USB port for reprograming became apparent. Final result simply turns a
cam that lifts lid against gravity rather than being bolted to the lid via a lever

Power control was attempted through various direct FET drive methods but was constrained
by limited 3.3V power from micro controller. Expensive but effective solution achieved 
through a COTS Polulo power switch PCB intended for toggle operation. While no schematic 
was provided tracing of layout indicated that pulling low one side of the toggle switch
acted to latch 'on' while the existing latch 'off' was used to power down the servos
and micro controller once timeout from user interaction had expired.
